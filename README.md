# shoe-shop

## Simple project to demonstrate how Microservices work

## Every part of the project (store, users and etc) works independent of the other parts of the project. Each part has its own virtual env with complete django config

## In real project, we should put every part of the project in a separated repository but for demonstration  of our work we put every part in one repository
